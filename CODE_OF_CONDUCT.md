# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant.

## Our Expectations
- Be respectful and inclusive. No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Assume good intent, give constructive feedback, and keep discussions project-focused.
- Accept responsibility for mistakes and work to resolve conflicts in good faith.

## Scope
This Code applies across all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, chat) and when representing the project in public.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers clarify and enforce this Code, may remove or edit non-compliant content, and may warn or restrict contributors when needed.

## Enforcement Guidelines
- **Correction.** A private or public note requesting changes to problematic content.
- **Warning.** An official warning for a first or repeated violation.
- **Temporary Restriction.** Time-limited ban from participation for repeated violations.
- **Permanent Ban.** Removal from the community for severe or sustained misconduct.

## Reporting
Report unacceptable behavior privately via a GitHub issue marked **confidential** (or draft) requesting a maintainer contact, or via the maintainers’ GitHub profiles: **Daniel Thermons**, **Alex Girin**, **Vincent Brook**. Provide links, timestamps, and context where possible. We aim to acknowledge within 7 days and handle reports discreetly.

Security vulnerabilities should be reported per **SECURITY.md** (not via this channel).
